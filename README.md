# Gesture-Language-Dataset-and-Fusion

This dataset is a publicly available resource designed to simulate simple scenes of varying complexity (`scene_types`). 
The file `objects.json` describes all available objects. 
`data_config.json` is intended for use with potential multimodal models. 
`scenes_config folder` outlines general scenes across different complexity levels.

The data includes individual `.csv` files categorized by size and modality.

A more detailed description is planned to be added by April 20, 2025.
